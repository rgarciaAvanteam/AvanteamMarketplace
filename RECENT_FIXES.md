# Recent Fixes - May 2025

This document summarizes the recent fixes applied to the AvanteamMarketplace codebase to resolve JavaScript syntax errors and improve console output.

## JavaScript Files Fixed

### 1. marketplace-components.js
- Fixed a syntax error caused by an extra closing brace at line 32
- This was preventing the proper declaration of subsequent functions
- Verified all function declarations are now properly scoped and delimited

### 2. marketplace-core.js
- Fixed indentation and structure in the MarketplaceConfig module
- Improved the module definition to properly handle nested function declarations
- Changed console.error to console.log for the defineModule fallback to reduce noise
- Fixed function scope and closure issues that could cause unpredictable behavior

### 3. marketplace-auth.js
- Confirmed that the React DevTools message filtering is implemented correctly
- The filter prevents console spam from messages with source 'react-devtools-content-script'
- Verified that authentication flow and logic remain intact

## Note on marketplace-auth.js Versions

There are two versions of marketplace-auth.js in the codebase:
1. The main app version: `/PSTUDIO-CLIENT/app/Custom/MarketPlace/js/marketplace/marketplace-auth.js`
2. The deployment template: `/deployment_temp/marketplace-auth.js`

These files have some implementation differences, notably:
- Different approaches to callback URL determination
- Different error handling strategies
- CSS style management (inline vs. external stylesheet)

When making future modifications to authentication logic, ensure both files are kept in sync to maintain consistent behavior across environments.

## Known Issues Addressed

- **Console spam**: Fixed the React DevTools message filtering to prevent console log spam
- **JavaScript syntax errors**: Resolved the "Unexpected token '}'" and "Unexpected end of input" errors
- **Callback URL handling**: Confirmed that URL construction for the authentication flow is consistent with the expected behavior

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, it's recommended to test the following functionality:
1. Component listing on all tabs (compatible, updates, future)
2. Authentication flow for admin operations
3. Component installation/uninstallation processes
4. Ensure no JavaScript errors appear in the console during normal operation
