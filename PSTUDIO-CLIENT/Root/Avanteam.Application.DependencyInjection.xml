            Gets or sets a value indicating whether ApplicationContext should be setup using a
            DbContextPool or not. This is recommended for applications that create a lot of service
            scopes (typically web applications that will create one per request). But is overkill for
            most win form or console applications that generally use a single application scope for
            itâ€™s whole lifetime.
